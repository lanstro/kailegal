							<p class="publication-back-top"><a href="#publications-heading" class="anchor">top</a></p>
							
							<h3 id="Research">Research the market</h3>
							<p>Once you decide which area(s) you want to buy in, familiarise yourself with property value there.  We recommend:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Attending inspections and auctions of similar properties in the area.</li>
								<li>Checking the weekly REIV auction and private sale <a href="http://www.reiv.com.au/Property-Research/Auction-Results" class="anchor" target="_blank">results</a> for your area (select your suburb towards the bottom of the page).</li>
								<li>For older sales, check the free websites at <a href="http://www.realestate.com.au/sold" class="anchor" target="_blank">realestate.com.au</a>, <a href="http://house.ksou.cn/" class="anchor" target="_blank">soldprice</a> and <a href="http://www.getsoldprice.com.au/" class="anchor" target="_blank">getsoldprice</a>.</li>
								<li>You can also pay for a comprehensive property report from a property data provider, or ask the real estate agent for a free report.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>Consumer Affairs Victoria also has a helpful <a href="http://www.consumer.vic.gov.au/housing-and-accommodation/buying-and-selling-property/buying-property/understanding-property-prices" class="anchor" target="_blank">guide</a> about property prices.</p>
							
							<p class="publication-back-top"><a href="#publications-heading" class="anchor">top</a></p>
							
							<h3 id="Due-diligence">Do your due diligence</h3>
							<p>It is hard to back out of a property sale contract after you’ve signed it, so make sure you check it properly before you sign!</p>
							<p>The mandatory <a href="http://www.consumer.vic.gov.au/duediligencechecklist" class="anchor" target="_blank">due diligence checklist</a> given at inspections is a great starting point for questions you should be asking, to make sure you understand exactly what you are buying.</p>
							<p>For a property that you plan on living in, seriously consider getting a professional, independent building inspection done before making an offer, or bidding.</p>
							<p>Consumer Affairs Victoria has further <a href="http://www.consumer.vic.gov.au/housing-and-accommodation/buying-and-selling-property/buying-property/inspect-properties-before-you-buy" class="anchor" target="_blank">tips</a> on inspecting property.</p>
							
							<p class="publication-back-top"><a href="#publications-heading" class="anchor">top</a></p>
							
							<h3 id="Financing">Get your financing</h3>
							<p>In other words, know your budget.  You shouldn’t ever make an offer or a bid at auction unless you know that you can afford it, and that you will have the funds ready in time for settlement (which can be two very different things!)</p>
							<p>The Fitzroy Legal Service has a good <a href="http://www.lawhandbook.org.au/handbook/ch14s01s04.php" class="anchor" target="_blank">overview</a> of financing options for property purchases.  See also the Australian government’s <a href="https://www.moneysmart.gov.au/life-events-and-you/life-events/buying-a-home" class="anchor" target="_blank">MoneySmart</a> website.</p>
							<p class="publication-back-top"><a href="#publications-heading" class="anchor">top</a></p>
							
							<h3>Understand your loan documents</h3>
							<p>If a lender is financing part of your loan, these tend to be long-term arrangements that will have a significant impact on your financial life over many years, so read the documents and fully understand your obligations!</p>
							<p>In our experience, Australian banks are increasingly outsourcing the drafting of these agreements overseas, and there are often errors in the loan documents that you or your lawyer need to raise and get fixed.</p>
							<p>For the basics of home loans, see the Australian Government’s <a href="https://www.moneysmart.gov.au/borrowing-and-credit/home-loans" class="anchor" target="_blank">MoneySmart</a> website.</p>
							<p>If you are still unsure about the loan documents, your lawyer or financial planner should be able to help.</p>
							
							<p class="publication-back-top"><a href="#publications-heading" class="anchor">top</a></p>
							
							<h3 id="Costs">Know the transactional costs</h3>
							<p>Beyond the purchase price, there are many additional costs:</p>
							<ul class="publication-list">
								<li>
									<p><strong>Stamp duty</strong></p>
									<p>See the <a href="http://www.sro.vic.gov.au/SRO/SROCalcs.nsf/transfer?OpenForm" class="anchor" target="_blank">State Revenue Office</a> website. Stamp duty laws can be complex, so speak to your lawyer to find out whether you are entitled to any concessions, reductions or exemptions.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p><strong>GST</strong></p>
									<p>GST is payable on most commercial properties: speak to your lawyer or accountant to find out whether GST is payable and whether you can claim it back.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p><strong>Loan application and other borrowing costs</strong></p>
									<p>Speak to your bank or broker.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p><strong>Government fees</strong></p>
									<p>The land title transfer fee is currently up to $1,366, and mortgage registration fee is currently $111.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p><strong>Rates and charges</strong></p>
									<p>This includes council rates, land tax, other rates and utility charges and body corporate fees: most of these will be disclosed on the section 32 vendor’s statement.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p><strong>Legal or conveyancing costs</strong></p>
									<p>Speak to your lawyer or conveyancer.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p><strong>Other once-off costs</strong></p>
									<p>This includes building inspection fees, moving costs, utility connection fees, and the cost of any repairs or renovations that will need to be done before or when you move in.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p><strong>Other on-going costs</strong></p>
									<p>This includes ongoing mortgage repayments, and home and contents insurance.</p>
								</li>
							</ul>
							
							<p class="publication-back-top"><a href="#publications-heading" class="anchor">top</a></p>
							
							<h3 id="Lawyer">Get a lawyer or conveyancer</h3>
							<p>Get a lawyer or conveyancer involved once you are seriously considering purchasing a property.</p>
							<p>The special conditions on contracts of sale are often complicated and are drafted to benefit of the vendor.  Off-the-plan contracts can be hundreds of pages long.  <strong>Make sure you get advice before signing anything!</strong></p>
							<p>Some real estate agents might pressure you into signing an offer without getting legal advice first, telling you that you can always use your cooling-off rights.</p>
							<p>You should never sign something you don’t really understand, and hope that you can get out of it later.  In any case, cooling off can cost you thousands of dollars (0.2% of the purchase price, and at least $100), and those rights can be easily lost if you are careless.  Also, there are no cooling off rights when you buy at an auction, or within 3 days before or after one. See Consumer Affairs Victoria for more <a href="http://www.consumer.vic.gov.au/housing-and-accommodation/buying-and-selling-property/buying-property/buying-property-by-private-sale#cooling-off-on-a-property-sale" class="anchor" target="_blank">details</a>.</p>
							<p>Some lawyers and conveyancers, including us, offer to review most contracts of sale and vendor’s disclosure statements for free. There’s little reason not to take advantage of the offer.</p>
							<p>As for retaining a lawyer or a conveyancer, the main difference is that lawyers can advise and act on broader issues like the most tax effective ways of making the purchase, how to jointly buy, and related legal disputes, like recovering damages if a party cancels the sales contract or fails to settle.  See Consumer Affairs Victoria for more <a href="http://www.consumer.vic.gov.au/housing-and-accommodation/buying-and-selling-property/buying-property/seek-expert-advice-on-property." class="anchor" target="_blank">details</a>.</p>
							
							<p class="publication-back-top"><a href="#publications-heading" class="anchor">top</a></p>
							
							<h3 id="Holding-property">Decide how to hold the property</h3>
							<p>This step is often skipped, when a little thought and planning could have led to income tax savings each year, or avoiding or reducing a large stamp duty or capital gains tax liability later on.</p>
							<p>There are a variety of ways for a typical family purchasing a property to hold it, including:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>in one of their names only;</li>
								<li>in their names jointly, as joint tenants;</li>
								<li>in their names jointly, as tenants in common; </li>
								<li>in a family trust or unit trust; or</li>
								<li>in a family company.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>Each option has different income tax, stamp duty, family law, estate planning and practical differences for now and in the future. We strongly recommend at least having a short chat with your lawyer or accountant about your circumstances, future plans with the property, and which of these (or other) options would work best for you.</p>
							
							<p class="publication-back-top"><a href="#publications-heading" class="anchor">top</a></p>
							
							<h3 id="Owners-corporation">Owner’s Corporation Rules</h3>
							<p>If you’re buying an apartment, unit or townhouse, there is likely to be some shared areas or facilities that are managed by an owner’s corporation.</p>
							<p>The rules in an owner’s corporation can be quite restrictive and even intrusive.  The fees can be quite high.  Make sure they are acceptable to you.</p>
							<p>Consumer Affairs Victoria has a useful <a href="http://www.consumer.vic.gov.au/housing-and-accommodation/buying-and-selling-property/checklists/buying-an-apartment-or-unit" class="anchor" target="_blank">checklist</a> of things to consider when buying these sorts of properties.</p> 
							
							<p class="publication-back-top"><a href="#publications-heading" class="anchor">top</a></p>
							
							<h3 id="Planning">Know the planning rules</h3>
							<p>If you plan on making any changes to the property, from a minor renovation to a full rebuild, make sure the land is such that it is physically possible, and that you are legally allowed to do so.</p>
							<p>The vendor’s statement gives you some idea of restrictions like the zoning of the property and planning overlays (such as a heritage overlay) which apply.</p>
							<p>Calling the local council is usually a good way to find out more for smaller projects.</p>
							<p>For major changes, you may need legal advice from a lawyer and advice from an architect, town planner or other experts.</p>
							<p class="publication-back-top"><a href="#publications-heading" class="anchor">top</a></p>
							
							<h3 id="Auction">Understand the auction rules</h3>
							<p>If you are buying at auction, make sure you know the rules first.  Consumer Affairs Victoria has a good practical guide to <a href="http://www.consumer.vic.gov.au/housing-and-accommodation/buying-and-selling-property/buying-property/buying-property-at-auction" class="anchor" target="_blank">how auctions work</a>.</p>
							<p>If you have never attended a property auction before, we recommend attending a few before yours, to get a practical feel of the process.</p>
							<p>Finally, the most important things at an auction are:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>doing all your due diligence and checking of the contract of sale before attending: there is no cooling off for auctions!</li>
								<li>having a firm figure for the highest amount you are willing to bid, and sticking to it;</li>
								<li>if you need a loan to complete the purchase, getting written pre-approval from your lender (very rarely will vendors at auction accept a financing condition); and</li>
								<li>having the funds ready to pay a 10% deposit on the day.</li>
							</ul>
							<p class="publication-back-top"><a href="#publications-heading" class="anchor">top</a></p>
							
							<h3 id="Private-sale">Negotiate everything in private sales</h3>
							<p>Many properties are still sold by private sale in Victoria.  Without much of the urgency and competition of an auction, there is much greater scope to negotiate price, terms and conditions, and the settlement date.</p>
							<p>We recommend Consumer Affairs Victoria’s <a href="http://www.consumer.vic.gov.au/housing-and-accommodation/buying-and-selling-property/buying-property/buying-property-by-private-sale" class="anchor" target="_blank">guide</a> to private sales to understand the basics.</p>
